                     <p>
                This site was developed by Group 4 of the Business Analytics and Information Systems program offered by the University of South Florida, Cohort 2019.
                The goal of this site is to showcase the application of skills and concepts learend in Distributed Information Systems course.

                Focusing on, user interfaces we created a static web site, using the common interface elements such as images, styles and html tags.
                Our topic of interest within the group was to showcase food and drinks based on our interest. These informative pages highlights food items and drinks
                from various cultures.

                The website is responsibe and compatible with mobile platforms and web browsers, through the integration of style sheets. Offering consistent navigation through each of the pages,
                allowing the end user to quickly access the navigation from one page to another.
